## TRANSFORM TO HTC VIVE
- First 2 versions
- Avatars might need to be replaced with simplier (ghosts or handless robots)
- How the transitions will happen when spawning, from and to the rooms etc
- Dragging might need to be removed
- Stories from real life visitors accompanying artworks 
- The way it will be represented depends on the nature of each story 
- Each story may have a counter of likes and dislikes
- For each round, there will be a story which will be the round winner (depending on the likes) and an all time scoreboard
- Treasure hunt might be a good idea for a game
- Hand poses (thumbs up/down etc)
